*This problem has many steps to it. You have been warned!*
The Christmas Tree Hash (CTH) takes in a series of numbers that describe the ornaments found on each "branch", or "layer" of the tree. We will follow a basic example to find our encryption key. This is the input we will use:
3
2	5	7
3	4

The top row of numbers describes different trees, as denoted by the number on their star. These numbers can be the same (two exact copies of the tree). Each row after the first one represents a branch of the tree. The numbers on each branch are children to each parent in the branch above. If we were to draw a tree diagram for this example, it would look like this:
     __ 3 _ _
   /    |    \
  2     5     7
 / \   / \   / \
3   4 3   4 3   4

The following steps will be repeated for each tree; we only have one tree in our current example.
(1) The first step in the CTH is to find the product of all the branches in the tree. First, we start with 3. Next, we traverse down the first value in the next branch, which is 2. Our next value will be 3 * 2 = 6. Continuing down, our next value is 3 * 2 * 3 = 18. Since we cannot go further down, we go back up a branch and try the next value, which will be 3 * 2 * 4 = 24. Now we go all the way back and continue down the middle path. Next in the sequence is 3 * 5 = 15. Continue on until you reach the last number of the last branch. The numbers for this example are: 
3, 6, 18, 24, 15, 45, 60, 21, 63, 84

(2) The next step is to swap each entry in our list of products with its neighbor. 3 and 6 swap, 18 with 24, etc. After the pairs swap, we reverse our list. The current list is:
63, 84, 60, 21, 15, 45, 18, 24, 3, 6

(3) For each number in our list, we will replace it with a lowercase letter in the alphabet. 0 is replaced by 'a', 1 with 'b', 2 with 'c', ...and 25 with 'z'. If the number is greater than 25, use the number % 26 to get the letter. Join the array together to form a string. Our string is:
"lgivptsydg"

(4) Take this string and convert it into binary. Once we have the binary value of the string, we will perform a bitwise and (&) on the first 16 bits and the last 16 bits of the binary value. a is the first 16 bits, and b is the last 16 bits for our example:
a: 1101100110011111
b: 0111001001100111
a & b: 20487

(5) Separate the string into groups of 2, leaving the last one alone if the length is odd. Add the sum of these groups to a string, and repeat steps 1-5 for each tree. Again, there is only 1 tree in this example.
Groups: 20, 48, 7
Tree Result: '75'

(6) In order to add another layer of complexity, Adam decided that he wanted to take the numerical value for the string produced from all of the trees, and subtract the following value from it (note that the ^ symbol here represents a power/exponent, not a bitwise or):
365^5 + 52^10 + 7^20 + 457981573849226022
New Value: -682335424444623097

(7) We will now repeat the first part of Step 5 (splitting the value into groups of two), followed by Step 3 (replacing each group with a letter value). Once we join the resulting list together, we have our encryption key.
Key: 'uehcysuxjh'

Here is a quick explanation of how to find the key given multiple trees. The following uses two trees:
1	2
3	4	3
5	6

The tree diagram looks the same for both trees, with the exception of the star (root):
     ___ 1,2 ___
   /      |      \
  3       4       3
 / \     / \     / \
5   6   5   6   5   6

The following are the results produced from each string:
Tree 1: '131'
Tree 2: '111'
Result: '131111'
Key: 'uehcyssogb'
